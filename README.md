2017 Yellow Taxi Trip Data Challenge
Introduction
The aims of my to analyze and model New York's 2017 Yellow Taxi Trip Data to predict trip duration and fare amounts. 
The dataset includes essential trip details like pick-up and drop-off times, locations, distances, fares, and passenger counts from two taxi vendors. 
Although this dataset is quite large, Iâ€™ve approached this project with scalable methods, with an option to work on data samples for efficient handling.

Project Tasks
1. Trip Duration Prediction
Objective: Build a model that predicts trip duration using selected features.
Approach: Algorithm choices are justified to provide clear reasoning behind model selection.
2. Total Fare Prediction
Objective: Develop a model predicting total fare paid by customers.
Approach: Uses features identified in Task 1 and additional relevant data points.
3. Model Evaluation
Objective: Assess model accuracy and discuss alternative evaluation methods.
Requirements: Includes coded metrics and reporting to justify outcomes.
4. Predictor Importance
Objective: Identify key predictors for each model.
Methodology: Explanation of feature importance through model-specific techniques.
5. Version Control and Documentation
The project is versioned on GitHub with this README to guide users in reproducing results.
